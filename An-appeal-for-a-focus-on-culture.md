## Why did I write this?
The purpose of the hackerspace is to be the catalyst to solving many issues that face the creative people of Lafayette.  Therefore, it is imperative that we properly define the culture that needs to be cultivated within the hackerspace. That's straightforward in my head, but may not be for others, so here's a logical breadown.
## Proof
##### If 
    the issues facing the creative people of Lafayette require a cultural shift 
##### and if
    cultural shifts in one culture (we'll call it 'A') 
    
    come about through another culture ('B') influencing culture A 
    
    by overriding aspects of culture A that are in conflict 
        with opposing aspects in culture B
##### then
    culture B must be strong enough to win conflicts with culture A.

##### If
    a new culture needs to be strong enough to override another culture
##### then
    it must have a safe place where it is free to grow and strengthen 
    before clashing with other cultures.

#### Conclusion: Since the issues facing the creative people of Lafayette require a cultural shift, Lafayette needs a safe place to grow the new culture. 

#### Assertion: The safe place we are developing is a hackerspace.

##### If
    we are looking to solve issues facing the creative people of Lafayette 
##### and if
    good solutions are designed through understanding problems
##### then 
    we must identify and understand the problems 
    facing the creative people of Lafayette 
    before providing a solution.
#### Conclusion: We must watch the CES video and seek the core problems behind the issues raised in it.
##### If
    the hackerspace is meant to be a solution to those problems
##### then
    we must identify how it addresses them.
#### Conclusion: We must list the problems and specifically identify how the hackerspace addresses them.    
##### If
    the problems facing Lafayette's creative people requires a cultural shift
##### then
    the hackerspace must grow a culture that can lead to a cultural shift.

##### If 
    a hackerspace lives/dies based on its people and their interactions
##### Then 
    we have to properly determine who should seed our hackerspace 
        and how they should play together.

##### If
    culture describes a group of people and how they interact
##### and if
    a hackerspace lives/dies based on its people and their interactions
##### then 
    a hackerspace lives/dies based on its culture.

##### If    
    we have to properly determine who should seed our hackerspace
        and how they interact
##### then
    we have to identify who is a good cultural fit.
    
##### If
    we have to identify who is a good cultural fit
##### then
    we have to define a culture for them to fit in to.

#### Conclusion: We must define the culture of the hackerspace before we can properly choose the first members.

##### If 
    solutions are more likely to sufficiently solve problems when designed,
        rather than allowing them to unintentionally emerge
##### then 
    we should design solutions when sufficiency is needed, 
        rather than letting them emerge.
    
##### If 
    the chance of successfully solving hard problems increases by minimizing the number 
        of difficult things to address that are related to those problems
##### and if
    starting a hackerspace and 
    solving the problems facing the creative people of Lafayette
        are hard problems
##### Then
    we should reduce the number of difficult things 
       along the path to solving both

##### If 
    it's easier to define and direct a culture than to change an existing one
##### and if 
    a designed solution to the problems facing Lafayette's creative people 
       requires a new culture
##### and if
    we should reduce the number of difficult things 
       along the path to solving both
##### then
    we need to sufficiently design the culture, rather than allow it to emerge.
    

#### Conclusion: To start a hackerspace that won't culturally implode while addressing the issues facing Lafayette's creative people, we must define its culture. To maximize chance of success and to ease the efforts of an already difficult task, we must define the culture before we can properly determine who should seed the hackerspace.
