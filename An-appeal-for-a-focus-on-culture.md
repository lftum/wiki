The purpose of the hackerspace is to be the catalyst to solving many issues that face the creative people of Lafayette.  Therefore, it is imperative that we properly define the culture that needs to be cultivated within the hackerspace. Here's a logical breakdown.

If: the issues facing the creative people of Lafayette require a cultural shift 
                    and 
if: cultural shifts in culture A come about through culture B influencing culture A by overriding aspects of culture A that are in conflict with opposing aspects in culture B
then: culture B must be strong enough to win conflicts with culture A.

If: a new culture needs to be strong enough to override another culture
then: it must have a safe place where it is free to grow and strengthen before clashing with other cultures.

Conclusion: Since the issues facing the creative people of Lafayette require a cultural shift, Lafayette needs a safe place to grow the new culture. The safe place we are developing is a hackerspace.

If: we are looking to solve issues facing the creative people of Lafayette 
then: we must identify and understand those problems.

If: the hackerspace is meant to be a solution to those problems
then: we must identify how it addresses them.

If: hackerspaces live/die based on its people and their interactions
Then: we have to properly determine who should seed our hackerspace and how they should play together.

If: culture describes a group of people and how they interact
             and
If: we have to properly determine who should seed our hackerspace and how they interact
             and
If: the hackerspace is meant to grow a culture to provide the cultural shift needed to address issues facing the creative people of Lafayette
             and
If: it's better to solve problems intentionally than by accident
             and
If: it's easier to define a culture than to change an existing one
             and
If: culture can either be designed or emergent
             and
If: culture emerges as soon as people interact
             and
If: culture shift and hackerspaces are both hard problems
             and
If: the chance of successfully solving hard problems increases by minimizing the number of difficult things to address that are related to those problems

Then: To maximize success and to ease the efforts of an already monumental task, we must define the culture that will address the issues facing Lafayette's creative people and we must do it before we can properly determine who should seed the hackerspace.
