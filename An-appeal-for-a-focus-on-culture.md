# Why did I write this?
The purpose of the hackerspace is to be the catalyst to solving many issues that face the creative people of Lafayette.  Therefore, it is imperative that we properly define the culture that needs to be cultivated within the hackerspace. That's straightforward in my head, but may not be for others, so here's a logical breadown.

##### If 
    the issues facing the creative people of Lafayette require a cultural shift 
##### and if
    cultural shifts in one culture (we'll call it 'A') 
    
    come about through another culture ('B') influencing culture A 
    
    by overriding aspects of culture A that are in conflict 
        with opposing aspects in culture B
##### then
    culture B must be strong enough to win conflicts with culture A.

##### If
    a new culture needs to be strong enough to override another culture
##### then
    it must have a safe place where it is free to grow and strengthen 
    before clashing with other cultures.

#### Conclusion: Since the issues facing the creative people of Lafayette require a cultural shift, Lafayette needs a safe place to grow the new culture. 

#### Assertion: The safe place we are developing is a hackerspace.

##### If
    we are looking to solve issues facing the creative people of Lafayette 
##### and if
    good solutions are designed through understanding problems
##### then 
    we must identify and understand the problems 
    facing the creative people of Lafayette 
    before providing a solution.

##### If
    the hackerspace is meant to be a solution to those problems
##### then
    we must identify how it addresses them.
    
##### If
    the problems facing Lafayette's creative people requires a cultural shift
##### then
    the hackerspace must require a cultural shift.

##### If 
    a hackerspace lives/dies based on its people and their interactions
##### Then 
    we have to properly determine who should seed our hackerspace 
        and how they should play together.

##### If
    culture describes a group of people and how they interact
##### and if
    a hackerspace lives/dies based on its people and their interactions
##### then 
    a hackerspace lives/dies based on its culture.

##### If    
    we have to properly determine who should seed our hackerspace
        and how they interact
##### then
    we have to identify who is a good cultural fit.
    
##### If 
    solutions are more likely to sufficiently solve problems when designed,
        rather than allowing them to unintentionally emerge
##### then 
    we should design solutions when sufficiency is needed.

    
##### If 
    the hackerspace is meant to grow a culture to provide the cultural shift 
        needed to address issues facing the creative people of Lafayette
##### and if
If: it's better to solve problems intentionally than by accident
             and
If: it's easier to define a culture than to change an existing one
             and
If: culture can either be designed or it can emerge naturally
             and
If: culture begins emerging as soon as people interact
             and
If: culture shift and hackerspaces are both hard problems
             and
If: the chance of successfully solving hard problems increases by minimizing the number of difficult things to address that are related to those problems

Then: To maximize success and to ease the efforts of an already monumental task, we must define the culture that will address the issues facing Lafayette's creative people and we must do it before we can properly determine who should seed the hackerspace.
