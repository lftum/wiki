Hey, SYNHAK.

Its only been 8 days but I see that even when I'm not around I somehow cause 
drama. I think Einstein called that "Spooky Action at a Distance". SYNHAK and 
I are forever entangled at the quantum level.

My inbox is full of people asking for details about why I went on hiatus. I'm 
also aware of a board vote to remove me from my office of Treasurer, so I 
figure that I might as well join the fun and burn some bridges while I go down 
in beautiful crimson flames. An ex-synhakker (we've got those now!) told me 
that SYNHAK seems to have a pattern of taking Treasurers and stomping the 
ever-living crap out of them, so I'm obligated to take this personally.

I'd like to start with this wonderful snippet that was sent to 
members at synhak.org, which caused me to ragequit:

I'd like to resolve this issue by having Torie (Trevor Fisher) put on
suspension from SynHak (this will include SynHak's mailing lists and any
other service) for a giving amount of time.

I feel that she needs time to cool off for 3 months, 6 months a year? I'll
leave the time period up to the champions. Or at least until her sex change
is done (since it has been brought up to me that this "behavior" of her's
is due to her taking hormones. ) <-- not mentioned before since it's none
of my business.

Hormones or not, the other members and the community should not have to
suffer because of her antics.

Remember, folks: you voted this mental midget of a person onto the board :)

Lets not forget this other gem from a previous discussion with Steve Radonich 
concerning my efforts to make SYNHAK a Safe Space:

----8<----
Even if someone was a raging transphobe how would we know? I don't think it 
really has any bearing on whether they're going to be a member or not as long 
as they can keep civil and not let their personal feelings or beliefs keep 
them from getting a long with, at the very least putting up with someone who 
might be transexual. I highly doubt anyone at SYNHAK would think that is funny 
and find it offensive that you would even think that.
---->8----

Remember, folks: I'm someone who should be put up with! You all decided to go 
along with his plan to introduce more rules and bureaucracy to stop someone 
from forcing the community to address a situation where they feel completely 
unsafe!

I could also copy in some discussions I've had with folks around the 'net 
about the rack situation, but frankly I'm just tired of it and would prefer to 
notify the Akron Community Foundation, our insurance, the city's economic 
development team, Akron Public Library, and really any of the other 
organizations in the area that come to me asking about getting involved with 
details about the corruption in our board brought in by Justin and Devin. I'm 
sure they would also all love to hear about how the board feels that we've got 
enough of a drug problem to enact a drug policy.

When we started SYNHAK, we wanted to be better than noisebridge. Judging by 
the reactions of others when I explain the situation, I think we've succeeded 
in being a better drama mill than noisebridge:

<jontyw> London is measured in millinoisebridges
<evanmcc> that's totally rotten
<jontyw> Sounds like you're at at least several noisebridges
<evanmcc> "look, you've gotten dangerously close to me having to enage any 
empathy and for that I am going to punish you forever"

Congrats! I'm so proud of everyone. We are now (in)famous within the hacker 
communities.

Community, you've got the power to change this and fix things. SYNHAK doesn't 
have to have this shit. It can really be a nice place where everyone feels 
safe and there aren't constant power struggles between those who hate rules 
and those who wish to rule with an iron fist. I was hoping I could step away 
for a month or two, take a well deserved vacation, and come back to a 
hackerspace that is not on fire.

Looks like I was totally wrong :)
