Fabiola Sabogal (9/4, 9:15pm):

Cutting the umbilical cord to our afflictions. 
Rising awareness and understanding of the complex dynamics of human emotions and behaviors, relationships.

September 7

Crawford Comeaux (9/7, 5:50am):
So should I post to this page?
I'm already getting questions from my roommate about joining a page with such poor grammar 

Fabiola Sabogal (9/7, 6:26am):
Poor grammar where ?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/7, 6:32am):
Poor grammar ? Tell your roomate to get the stick out his ass , exactly what i mean - ego doesnt let ppl live- everybody just out to smart others , at the end nothing but ignorance and lack of meaning - tell him to join us, he is the perfect candidate of a the menial world we live in
September 7

Crawford Comeaux (9/7, 11:50am):
She...and I dunno about that. She's judgmental as hell

Fabiola Sabogal (9/7, 12:17pm):
We need to en enlist her lol
September 8

Fabiola Sabogal (9/8, 8:05am):
Amigo !!!!
So proud of you ! You said something more than meaningful - so profound
September 8

Crawford Comeaux (9/8, 4:47pm):
Jokes are more of a hobby 

Crawford Comeaux (9/8, 7:43pm):
Also, thanks! Glad you liked it! I'm about to drop a potential bomb on the group in a little bit. Wanna check it out before I do?
https://github.com/lftum/wiki/blob/master/Manifesto.md
I used to have a wiki setup so that anyone could anonymously edit that, but it got screwed up, so I'm gonna get it set back up again & then share the wiki link with the group.
September 9

Fabiola Sabogal (9/9, 9:49am):
Heyyyy
Talk about a bomb !??
Damn boy you are on a fire

Crawford Comeaux (9/9, 11:34am):
Haven't touched the manifesto in months. Been nursing wounds in isolation.
September 9

Fabiola Sabogal (9/9, 8:07pm):
Wow I am amazed

Crawford Comeaux (9/9, 8:07pm):
By what?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/9, 8:07pm):
I have read it in detailed and it's just mind blowing

Crawford Comeaux (9/9, 8:07pm):
Really??

Fabiola Sabogal (9/9, 8:07pm):
By activism tendencies
Yes!
I want on my team
Youuuu
You are a key player to get this nation out of the depression we live in

Crawford Comeaux (9/9, 8:08pm):
I guess I need to get that wiki back up & just put it out there.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/9, 8:08pm):
Please can you post it on the page for everyone to read
Post it wherever just post it
Ppl need to read it

Crawford Comeaux (9/9, 8:09pm):
I've just been beaten & bullied by all kinds of "supporters" over the past year, posting that makes me feel REALLY vulnerable.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/9, 8:09pm):
I need to write a manifesto for this new group -
FUCK THe menial souls of this world
you have meaning
You have a cause and I'll help you shove it ppls asses

Crawford Comeaux (9/9, 8:10pm):
Meaning left in isolation and without action is a waste.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/9, 8:10pm):
Well the action is here
Your time is now

Crawford Comeaux (9/9, 8:11pm):
Then I'll get the wiki up & post it ASAP

Fabiola Sabogal (9/9, 8:11pm):
I ll be your number one first supporter /fan / cheerleader /intellectual bitch lol
Alright alight

Crawford Comeaux (9/9, 8:12pm):
I've been waiting for one that actually helps carry the torch.
I need my first follower. I'm a lone nut til then. http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement?language=en

Watching now

Fabiola Sabogal (9/9, 8:13pm):

Crawford Comeaux (9/9, 8:29pm):

http://wiki.lftum.com/livepreview/index.html?page=Manifesto&path=%2F
boom...
adding a quick editing guide to it

Fabiola Sabogal (9/9, 8:32pm):
Boom in your faces bitches !

Crawford Comeaux (9/9, 9:01pm):
editing notes added...think it's too much?
or did I take too long and now you're asleep? 

Crawford Comeaux (9/9, 9:54pm):
aww boo...it doesn't go to the front of the page.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/9, 9:54pm):
Hold I am trying

Crawford Comeaux (9/9, 9:55pm):
should be pretty easy to change that setting for the page (though unsure when on mobile)
If you need to go to sleep, you can add me as an admin & I'll knock it out. Tech's kinda what I do...

Fabiola Sabogal (9/9, 9:59pm):
I will add you as am admin

Crawford Comeaux (9/9, 9:59pm):
I DID just write a program to make me be the 20000th liker on a page to win a $50 gift cert for my first tattoo... 
cool...I'll make it work somehow...you get your sleep

Fabiola Sabogal (9/9, 10:04pm):
Lol
Done !!!!
Made an admin
Will go to bed
And hit u up tomorrow

Crawford Comeaux (9/9, 10:04pm):
rockin...
and if I wind up getting trolled from this one post, I'm gonna abuse my position AND BURN IT ALL!
so anyone should be able to post to the main page, yes?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/9, 11:00pm):
Yes
I made u admin

Crawford Comeaux (9/9, 11:00pm):
i know...still trying to figure out how. sleep, you!
Wednesday

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 5:49am):
I'm up I'm up
Let's get to work

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:34am):
I've still got sleeping to do. Also, still haven't figured out wtf needs to be done to fix the page. I suspect listing it as a company/organization may have something to do with it.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:08am):
Nah I post with no problema
Why can't u just post it
Like a reg post like I ve been doing

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 9:50am):
I can redo it as a post from the page but would be nice if people's posts just show up in the page's timeline

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 10:28am):
They do !
I ve  posted it like 5 already
Let me see

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 10:29am):
Hmmmm
That went onto your timeline

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 10:30am):
Tick
Fuck I mean
Just post onto our page directly
And see what happens

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 10:31am):
Lol it goes to a section of the left called "Posts by Others"

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 1:23pm):
hey neat! I called out a smug as representative/apologist of "the man" for being smug and trying to shutdown the conversation & it worked! he posted something thoughtful and human, even though his perspective is myopic 

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 1:29pm):
smug ass*
Wednesday

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 6:38pm):
So it's all about afflictions - how to live with them - how to slowly rid of them or simply how to understand them and it's effect on the quality of the life we live and it's relation to others - like how to tame the beast - not just from bipolars - borderlines etc but from straight up ego and other devils in us

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 6:38pm):
So I was talking to someone else thinking it was your window god
I got a lil drunk or som
I ve started writing about mines and about ppl I know in general a year ago - it was meant to be sort of a book
So I need your help to shape our vision and our goals
The goal :
To save our American nation from the daily depression they live in / to give meaning
To help create a purpose from witching
within
Like i want to write a grant

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:41pm):
The situation in Lafayette informs that numbered list, but I know that it won't be comprehensive...it'll have an important place in the local context, but something greater's going to be needed outside that scope. You're talking about just applying the same kind of analysis I did here on a grander scheme...and I think that's a fucking exciting thing to think about.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 6:41pm):
and get the government to give us money to create  meaning
And give the forgotten side of society -  criminals / drug addicts
Weirdos
MEANING

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:41pm):
That's exactly who this is for!
Give me your downtrodden

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 6:42pm):
Yes !
Then good
We are on the same path

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:42pm):
give me your outcasts, your downtrodden. we are the weird.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 6:42pm):
I don't want to do comunity charity for churches - I want to do it for the opposite kind of ppl
We are the weird

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:43pm):
That manifesto welcomes the haves, but is designed for the have nots.
Are you familiar with Nahko and Medicine for the People? Have I already asked you that?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 6:44pm):
Well it all started when I was at a gas station and a crackhead knocking on my window and she scared the hell out of me - her eyes , her face was burnt - I immediately locked
The doors and then she just stood there starting ,waiting for me to look back at her -
So I did....
And put the window down and she asked me to please help her get home
That she had been around that area of town - the airport / ghetto area for 5 days and she just didn't have money to get home so I have her 10 dollars and a business card , asked her to call me when got home and felt better and that I would give her work
And then I thought - well fuck which rich lady's house I do landscaping for am I going to bring her without scaring ppl off
So I brought her to this field ( friend of mine ) no property or anything she could steal later and a lawnmower
And ever since then she stayed clean
And said alli need is something I do everyday when I don't I just go back to streets / Prostitute and do drugs

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:47pm):
Shocker. People just want to be treated like people.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 6:47pm):
Yes !
And if we start treating all ppl like ppl
We can ALL Be ppl together
We need to do this so bad / erase the stigmas and paradigms
And erase the mental divide in our so inert
society and we can begin in lafayette

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:48pm):
yes

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 6:48pm):
They are ao supportive there
Yes !

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:48pm):
who's so supportive here?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 6:49pm):
The whole town
If you think about
Ppl in lafayette are still warm

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:49pm):
I haven't felt a supportive community vibe around here for a long time if you're doing anything too different that isn't related to food.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 6:49pm):
They have still have the third world country kind of attitude
As much as we don't see it or want to admit it
It's one of the fastest metros in the states - it's a great place to start a business - to start a band but even better to start a movement
Tv stations , radio wi be supportive

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:50pm):
I'm biased. When do you come back?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 6:50pm):
It's big enough but small enough to spread the word fat
Fast

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:51pm):
Oh yeah...I can media whore with the best of them

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 6:51pm):
And then move on
I come back on Monday

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:51pm):
I can't do it alone.
Oh shit!

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:51pm):
......was not expecting that.
FUCKING GET HERE GIRL!!!!111!!1111ONEELEVENTY1!!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 6:51pm):
This is happening sooner than me and you ever thought
Make a wishhhh
Lol

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:52pm):
Don't have to! You're back on Monday!
We have shitloads to talk about.
Because you're right...Lafayette's primed HARD.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 6:52pm):
Yes totally !!!!
It is !
Lafayette is a great nuke - we make a statement there and we get ppl to listen - we got it down in any other state

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:53pm):
Like...in ways you probably don't even realize but I've been tracking this for a few years.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 6:53pm):
Have you ?

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:53pm):
Did I even mention that on the manifesto page?!!?!
holy shit...brain. on. fire.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 6:53pm):
Hahaha
I ve awaken the beast in us
Fuck this menial existence
Let's make history

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:54pm):
oh man...ok....this isn't even IN the manifesto!
ok...so one of the things that was so exciting about trying to get a makerspace going in Lafayette was that in order to get the cultural needs met in the creative community, it would require a new movement. Culture change.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 6:56pm):
So what do you propose

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:57pm):
With the makerspace...excuse me....HACKERspace acting as the creative hub in the city (because we really don't have any highly meaningful ones right now), it becomes much easier to begin a movement in the creative community!

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:59pm):
If we make sure to build the movement by first targeting the extreme outcasts/downtrodden, we'll be able to find the right initial seeds from all walks of life. People who aren't comfortable being around such diversity will be naturally kept back, ensuring we grow in a healthy supportive way.

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 6:59pm):
But here's the beauty of it, which you pretty much just said:

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:01pm):
we're growing a culture in a space/box whether it be a physical space/box or something more loosely defined. However you define the edges of what we're growing isn't important though...you just need to acknowledge that they exist. And then, since Lafayette is so small, we'll almost immediately be able to detect/track when a seed of our culture catches a breeze and start growing elsewhere, whether it's down the street or on the other side of town.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:02pm):
Exactly !!!
We ll be able to plant the seeds and watch them grow closely !

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:02pm):
Oh shit! Which means we can track its progress easily! Which means we gather steam easier! According to this thing i just read a few hours ago on a whim!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:02pm):
And then integrate them as a viable way of living

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:02pm):
http://time.com/53748/how-to-motivate-people-4-steps-backed-by-science/

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:02pm):
It more than just fighting for gay rights or environmental issues or being vegans

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:03pm):
SO MUCH MORE

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:03pm):
general acceptance and humanity

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:03pm):
U don't know how happy you make me right now
YES
Meaning
Purpose

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:03pm):
Yes!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:03pm):
Humbleness
Oh god
Well
We are going to change the world

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:03pm):
Oh you're gonna fucking flip when you see my notebook
Do you know about "women's circles"?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:06pm):
No

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:06pm):
there's a women's circle in town that my friend is a part of...we've got to get you into it if possible. you'd love it

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:06pm):
What is it
About the women that drum (
?

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:06pm):
nope
lemme draw something real quick

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:07pm):
Alright alright waiting

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:07pm):
ohai whiteboard! wanna just do a Google hangout??
I'm literally in an UL classroom right now holding unauthorized office hours (starting today)

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:13pm):

As

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:15pm):
Oh shit

Not that we are awaken either

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:16pm):

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:16pm):
Hahaha
Feel u about the roll go for it

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:22pm):
And that's why we need to go talk to Tilley when you get back.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:22pm):
Tilley tall Tilley ?

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:22pm):
Tilley tall Tilley !

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:24pm):
Haha
I know her
So she knows about This circle thing

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:25pm):
She's in it!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:26pm):
Ohhhh
So what do they do again
I mean
What you just said
But what about money,
I don't get it

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:29pm):
I don't know the specifics. Tilley can tell you and invite you to observe their calls. I think getting me access on that level would be much harder.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:33pm):
Well my best friend Jes is really good friends with her
So I will ask her to ask her
So pretty much we need to apply such a concept for our cause
And we need to tight it with monetary profit - we need money to help ppl
From anywhere we can get it make it
I am not too sure about a non profit anymore

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:34pm):
fuck non profit
too soon for that

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:35pm):
Yeah fuck non profit

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:35pm):
bothered with it in january, regretted it every step of the way after
incorporate only as much as needed when needed
we do nothing if there isn't an immediate need for it.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:35pm):
Well we can make money in very many creative ways

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:35pm):
oh so many

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:36pm):
I ve been thinking ...

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:36pm):
who are you? what do you do? whereabouts do you live/work? I MUST KNOW ALL THESE THINGS

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:36pm):
Lol who am I
I ve been asked that lately
A lot?
!!!

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:36pm):
that's a longer answer, I know...we can let that answer play out over time
cause there are so many ways to apply this

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:38pm):
Well I am from Venezuela / Lafayette is my home away from home - I have been loving in New Orleans for the past two years - and been driving back and forth I attend my business in lafayette .

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:45pm):
It's an egg...
take the outline in this map...
https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lafayette,+LA/@30.211995,-92.038569,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x86249c4364c5d89b:0xc94a752492f7ff13
draw an egg shape around it.
that outline's our embryo
oh damn...

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:47pm):
Haha
I draw a lot of embryo looking things

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:47pm):
great! you take lead on logo design XD

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:48pm):
Lol
Here's the manifesto I drew

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:49pm):
Summarized in one picture

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:49pm):
if we look at cities with healthier communities of this or that type, I bet we can find the outline of their "embryo", eg. this part here that looks like it should be a hip is actually an art district and that part where you'd think the head should be is actually a community center and here are the main routes connecting them, ie. the skeleton

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:49pm):
and if we do that a few times with different cities, we can start to find patterns/anti-patterns of movement design!
the architecture of movements! *gasp*

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:50pm):
I love it
That's why I am so fascinated with bottler documentaries and movies
Just to see the way they engineered it
Imagine that being for a good cause
Like I wanna to be part of proactive cultural genocide!!??
!
If you really look at it - it's all there / mission - goals - vision
( drawing)

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:51pm):
ZOMG
Proactive cultural genocide!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:51pm):
Haha

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:51pm):
I think you and I may sometimes be a poor choice of words
but I also think I know what you mean by that!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:52pm):
It just comes
And then we would define

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:52pm):
We don't have to kill the current culture, but we do need to be choosy about what we allow in from it.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:52pm):
But the meaning of our poor choices of words is just out of Thai world
We ll get writers to translate

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:52pm):
And we can't start letting that happen until after the culture we're growing is strong enough to stand on its own.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:52pm):
Can't translate genius
It is
Strong enough
It's going dormant

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:53pm):
strong in number

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:53pm):
I see

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:53pm):
strongly defined

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:53pm):
So what do you propose
I love asking you that
For some reason

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:53pm):
SO DO I!!!!
NOBODY EVER DOES AND MEANS IT!
THANK YOU!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:54pm):
What zodiac sign are you loco ????  U have to be an air somewhere in there

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:54pm):
Aquarius!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:54pm):
You are flying high up in those purples skies
Haha
NO FUcking

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:54pm):
So very!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:54pm):
WONDER

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:54pm):
hehe I know

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:54pm):
I am too !!!
Compadre!

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:54pm):
AWESOME!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:55pm):
Air air
Let's fire up the fire in ppl
It's all in them in us

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:55pm):
I always thought it weird that it's an air symbol cause I'm all about the water

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:55pm):
We just need to "plant the seed"
Just like in the move inception

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:55pm):
but I get the distinction

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:55pm):
Yes
I see it now too

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:56pm):
I haven't felt this way in 7 months. THANK YOU!
and this is so much better/hopeful than that was!
so what I propose is something I've already sort of started working on...
but the whole progression I feel is worth noting...
1. Define local cultural needs
(check)

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:57pm):
Check

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:57pm): (2. Define cultural values that meet those needs.):
Semi-check
that's the numbered list

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 7:58pm):
Ok taking notes
Keep on

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 7:58pm): (3. Compose the manifesto & call to action.):
Shit...I need my notes...
4. Define process through which potential movement members can be identified, as well as how well aligned they are.
I call it the "selection process" because this is an organic model that's based on genetic algorithms.
it's a geek thing I can explain better later on paper, but that's about all you need to know about it right now

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:02pm):
Every generation of growth goes through the selection process. The 0th (zero-th) generation (you, me, and possibly others if you know of any as aligned as we're feeling/seeming) go through it to help find the alignment, assuming there's no selection that's needed (ie. we wouldn't even start this step if we weren't already way aligned).

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:04pm):
Right
So we need a written plan - members

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:05pm):
Future generations (which include all members of the previous generation) go through it to find the alignment, but also as a cultural health check to detect misalignment growing within the culture. If major misalignment is detected (ie. unremorseful racism) in a potential member of the next generation, they are selected out.

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:05pm):
Can't get people to follow you without a general plan for them to follow

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:05pm):
I was thinking assigning groovy leaders to take of care of different issues
Oh yes I can
It's simple
Let's understand why we feel the way we feel

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:06pm):
totally

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:06pm):
How to live with it

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:06pm):
What we do at the beginning isn't nearly as important as figuring out what we're about and how we want to work/play/live

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:06pm):
And how to bring meaning into our lives on a daily basis to not be depressed In so many ways
We elaborate on that any way we want it
But ppl like u and me

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:06pm):
right

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:07pm):
Just wish they could say at the end of the day
Hey
"Thank you "
I feel alive
How do we
Do tht
On a greater scale

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:07pm):
purpose, mastery, autonomy
the intrinsic motivators

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:08pm):
How do we get
Them to feel this feeling of excitement and purpose we are feeling "together" right now
Yes !
I thought of our commandments to be moral values
1. Integrity
This would be like a religion

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:08pm):
Did you read what I linked to earlier about motivating people?
or glance at it at all?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:09pm):
Yes?
No

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:09pm):
sec

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:09pm):
Let me read

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:09pm):
you're about to type stuff that's already all over that page 
hell...we already have been XD
http://time.com/53748/how-to-motivate-people-4-steps-backed-by-science/

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:10pm):
Haha
There you go
We are on the same path even if we are not reading the same page

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:11pm):
totally

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:11pm):
I don't read much or think much I just feel - and let my heart do the talking
Well dude

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:11pm):
Start a cult
That's it
A religion
I wanna call t religion
Even though I hate religion

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:12pm):
stick with culture
religion is firm
culture flows and grows, evolves

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:12pm):
It's something else know
It's like a mix between religion cult and culture
We ll come up with a words
Word
Like the Nazies came up with theirs

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:13pm):
oh hey...just realized this today: root word of culture = cult...
how am i only getting that now?!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:14pm):
Lol
Wonders wanders
So

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:14pm):
lol...I get the feeling you and I are cut from the same kind of genius cloth. We have lots of evil ideas that can be redefined, refined, and repurposed towards good.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:14pm):
I want to galloping in white horses

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:14pm):
and then there are just some ideas we'd never do but have fun thinking about.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:15pm):
Like the key clans?
Klu klans
But for good
Exactly

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:15pm):
lol yeah...

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:15pm):
So
We should read into the Nazies way or carrying things out
I have and it's fascinating
The way the did it
Was
Wow
If it only would of ve been for good

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:16pm):
totally, but we've learned a whole lot more since then, too
Nazis got nothing on our cults of personality these days. We've got diehard republicans!
From the article on motivating people under the "Form a Cult" point:
"Not literally. No funky robes or animal sacrifice necessary."
^ fuck that...funky robes = a must
and we sacrifice the disney animals to the gods of copyleft

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:17pm):
Haha
What about sacrificing ego all together to begin with
How do we do that

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:18pm):
give it an animal form
what's the most vain animal?
peacock?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:18pm):
Hmmmm

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:18pm):
can you eat peacock?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:18pm):
What is that
A chicken
???
Rooster v
?

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:19pm):
burn a peacock feather

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:19pm):
What is a peacock ?
Lol
I ve heard that before
Fuck

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:19pm):
https://www.google.com/search?q=peacock&es_sm=93&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=f_gQVOOGPISbyATxvoGQAQ&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1551&bih=791
you've seen it before too, i'm sure

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:20pm):
Oh yes b
It's a bird !!!!
Birds fly
do these ones fly, ?

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:20pm):
ish
wing-aided fluttering high-jumping?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:21pm):
well I have a thing with birds
I don't eat and I subconsciously and obsessionally draw them
Without knowing I draw them

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:21pm):
they fly...looked it up

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:21pm):
I am drawing them
So we can't kill them
On our slogan
We need to think how to name ego

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:21pm):
nah...not real killing

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:21pm):
First things first
I know not really killing
But not imaginary either
Because we need to ultimately become birds

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:22pm):
ok

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:22pm):
And fly ..
Lol
Thank you
So anyways
Ego
And Jen
Then what u said
Culture
And then values

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:22pm):
Jen?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:23pm):
And then go from
Door to door killing ppls egotistical values
Thwn*
Then"

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:23pm):
ah ok

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:23pm):
We need to open ppls doors souls wide open
To get the point of living before dieing and still be waking if you know what I mean
again meaning

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:24pm):
after defining selection process, we enter into a cycle

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:24pm):
Fuxk I am gong in circles
I see
Defining selection

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:24pm):
LOOOOOOLLLLLL

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:24pm):
next steps are cycles and you're going in circles~!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:24pm):
This is why you are here
Keep focus
Cycles
Explain
Life is goes in circles / u end where you begun/ always . One way or another
Look at us

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:25pm):
not why i'm here.
not me.
WE!
Why WE are here! WE keep each other focused, help explain each other.
Stealing my friend's saying, but this is "me2we"
so the cycle is just the growth cycle
we define some limits to the group for the sake of diversity, but not quotas.
quotas are exclusive
one idea I had was caps.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:28pm):
What is that ?

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:28pm):
ie. max 10-15% white dudes allowed per generation

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:28pm):
Lol
White sdudes

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:29pm):
quotas require a minimum. caps are a maximum.
instead of saying "we need more poor people," we just acknowledge that people with money have a fair representation within the group.
dunno about this whole part...needs testing.
anyway, the general step is to figure out a recruitment plan that maintains a diverse group without necessarily forcing diversity because diverse perspectives are required for good creativity
one way to do that is by crafting selection process in such a way that removes as much bias as possible. (this is a much more intricate convo for later)
anyway, figure out how to recruit/market, get some candidates going through the selection process, and let in a few in based on whatever goals are set for that generation
but don't pull the trigger til the culture's nice and solid within the current generation
because current gen = stewards of the culture to next gen
is this making sense?
if not, don't worry...it will as soon as we get to hang cause I know this shit back and forth. I spent months figuring it out.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:34pm):
Perfect sense

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:34pm):
awesome!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:34pm):
Just was thinking of the candidates

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:34pm):
so that's the growth cycle...
keep thinking of candidates...I suggest we build out the manifesto next week as generation-0
and worry about candidates for gen-1
unless there's a single person you can think of who should be in gen-0
if gen 0 is 3 people, my vote would be for Tilley
And I've got good gen-1 candidates, too. But for the first go round, we want to keep things way small to maximize individual contributions.
Not enough to feel like we've both contributed to it...we have to demonstrate it. Because that sets the example for future generations.
That becomes harder to do with more people, which is why I suggest max 3 for gen-0, but aim to get to next gen asap
sabes?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:39pm):
Entiendo Entiendo
Gen1

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:40pm):
!!!!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:40pm):
So
Would u please write down in a simple list on word
The initial steps
Of I can jai tread back
And. Try to so it
But u do it too
One page
Steps I initiate this
Selection and cycle and generetipna

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:41pm):
just go to wiki.lftum.com
and make a new page. we'll be able to see whatever we create on there without needing to send files or share links
I called mine "Craw words"
oooh...I'm gonna do mine real nice. Cause I got diagrams and shit in my dry-erase notebook...just need to grab it & take notes
take pics*

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:42pm):
Yes sir
Will do so

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:42pm):
sweet!
i'll outline the plan

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:43pm):
Will now try to to to bed to my dog snoring and mom

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:43pm):
good luck!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:43pm):
Yes please
I will work on that wiki tomorrow

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:43pm):
oh lol...

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:43pm):
http://wiki.lftum.com/New-Plan
puppy snores hard!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:44pm):
That a my mom now lol
Hahahah

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:44pm):
HA

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:44pm):
Puppy snores hard
Hahahaha
U are cracking me up

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:45pm):
So I guess I'll just kinda flesh out that "New Plan" page instead 
since it's already been started months agoXD

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:45pm):
U think ?
U do your thing

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:45pm):
BTW: did I put anywhere what LFTUM stands for?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:45pm):
I ll write my thing
And we will unite our things
Ghazals
Hahah
U got the technical part DOWN

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:46pm):
it started off being Lafayette Unnamed Makerspace

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:46pm):
I Need to look into my notes and make an outline of the feel of it

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:46pm):
but now LFTUM = Lab For Things You Make

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 8:46pm):
What is it about
Ur slogan v

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 8:47pm):
pure creative freedom
experiment in the lab for things you make to make whatever you goddamn please
make some words, thoughts, emotions, dances, paintings, boats, programs, robots, people
all the people create all the things in the lab for things you make
that's a specific context though...we need to think about the movement first
anyway...you sleep. i add words and try not to explode from excitement.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 9:05pm):
Hahaha
I was making notes
Don't u fucking love that feeling running through you rightnow

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 9:05pm):
SO MUCH!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 9:05pm):
It's like getting off intellectually forme is better than sex
There
A secret of mine
Adiosssssssss -

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 9:06pm):
WAY more stimulating than most sex by far!
Lol...way to tell a secret that any person who's ever felt this way already knows

Fabiola Sabogal (9/10, 9:07pm):
Good night My other half !

Crawford Comeaux (9/10, 9:07pm):
Goodnight! Time to find food to fuel the writing!
Thursday

Fabiola Sabogal (9/11, 6:02am):
Good morning !!!! It's 1pm here ! And I am heading to the beach - going to meditate everything we talked about last night ! - am so pumped - 
Thursday

Got tired of googling "what time is it in Spain"...


Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 2:47am):
Omg omg! I am so sorry in my delayed answer - I have been trying to not engage my phone as much (request by the snorting puppy aka" my mom ") so everytime I peak on here she looks at me long enough for
Me go feel bad that I am about to leave and not spending quality "real ppl" time here ...
Friday

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 6:33am):
No worries and no rush!
Now I go back to sleep 

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 8:16am):
Heyyyy
My partner in crime

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 8:21am):
Hehe...as long as we don't model ourselves after Bonnie & Clyde.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 8:21am):
Lol
I am reading all the posts
Now

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 8:22am):
I prefer Mungojerrie & Rumpelteazer, personally. But I grew up with musical theater, so I'm weird like that.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 8:22am):
Crawford !
I like you !

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 8:23am):
Well duh!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 8:23am):
Lol

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 8:23am):
I like you!
Like begets like!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 8:23am):
My Aquarius brother

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 8:25am):
lol so where do u work
I am printing articles

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 8:26am):
What's that a photo of?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 8:26am):
It was a pocket dial kind of photo

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 8:28am):
Are my jokes too subtle in the group? Like how I'm claiming to be so aware but can't say how I got there?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 8:29am):
Lol
Maybe remark it was a joke - I thought u were being dead serious
Lol
Tell us how
I will tell how I got my 50 % there

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 8:32am):
Great! Cause I can't even figure out a ballpark number!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 8:32am):
lol
What do you play. ?

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 8:33am):
And as for working, I consider that the root of all evil!
Kidding
Trying to find or form a collaborative work environment for myself. Without that, I'm slow & tend to get fired.
Don't really play any instruments anymore. I just look like I do. I'm a programmer. Tech/science/math/analysis is where my creativity gets applied.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 8:39am):
I agree with you about " work " is the root of all evils
It should be one of our focus
We need top find a way for ppl to have time
TO THINK TO FEEL And not just do do do do
Need to force them into isolation
Lol
Trap them in. A cave

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 8:43am):
Ooh! I have another article I was reading on productivity for the sake of free time.
You're spooky serendipitous. Lots of goosebumps to come next week, I bet.
Brb...finishing my shower

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 8:54am):
People who do work without ever having to stop and think about things are in a form of enslavement almost (too strong of a word, but that's what I'm running with for this thought). 
If their job doesn't require thought, that's a job just waiting to be replaced by a robot/computer.

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 8:56am):
That's what I do. I write programs that, in one context, make people's jobs obsolete. But the way I view it is that I'm freeing up their time to direct their attention/thoughts toward something more meaningful

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 9:02am):
Or at least giving them the option to pursue something more meaningful. If they sometimes get meaning from that work, I don't want to take that away. Just want to give them the choice

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 9:11am):
Driving to NOLA for the day now. Later!
Friday

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 5:37pm):
When I get back from NOLA, I'll be finally tackling the new plan page
Also, did I tell you about "office hours"?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 5:38pm):
Crawford! I was about to txt you
No

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 5:38pm):
OF COURSE YOU WERE!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 5:38pm):
Yes
I was gonna say
CRAWFORD WE ARE MAKING A REALITY show
We are getting a camera
And we are asking questions
To everybody and their mommas and it will help us develope our master plan

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 5:39pm):
HA! You are gonna LOVE "office hours" cause there's gonna be some candid camera stuff!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 5:39pm):
Along with your theories
What is it
I want to ask questions and I want you there with me to apply the theories to my digging
I LOVE digging

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 5:40pm):
There's this comp sci freshman who asked me months ago to hang out & show him the ropes of the coding world, but neither of us stayed in touch til he reached out a week ago.
Two nights ago, I sent him this...


Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 5:42pm):
Lol
Seriously ?

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 5:42pm):
We hung out for 2 hours with me teaching him random things.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 5:43pm):
Lol
So office hours would be about learning ...

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 5:43pm):
So he wants to meet almost every night

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 5:44pm):
Lol for free lessons on coding?


Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 5:46pm):
Lol

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 5:46pm):
Free whatever lessons! Collaborative learning to support all

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 5:46pm):
Yes !!!!
Office hours should be a group

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 5:46pm):
He's a shy kid but he's so jazzed about this that he wants to share it!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 5:46pm):
Listen

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 5:46pm):
Absolutely!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 5:47pm):
CRAWFORD !

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 5:47pm):
Oh! AND THE DIGGING! GONNA BLOW YOUR MIND WITH STUFF!
Want to start the easiest most fun & helpful business consulting company ever?! For good money?
Get paid to dig!
Sorry...you were saying? (I get ramble when excited and off my meds )

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 5:48pm):
Hahaha
No please finish
So get paid to dig
Whaaaat

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 5:49pm):
I just need to grab a link to finish it.
You go

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 5:49pm):
( I am the same when I get excited )
Okokok

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 5:51pm):
The goal is to developer groups within the OUR GROUP with assigned expert leaders to tackle on different "missions" to bring understanding and awareness on different areas /fields -  so coming up with different names for different teams is needed - we need to put it all together within one

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 5:51pm):
So when we go all out with it - we go out with all of our thousand of ideas projects
Visions goals - with the same purpose -
What is the purpose CRAWFORD ?!
So if we all are equal with one same equal goal we will bring one equal world together into organization
Like I see sort of
change.org
Kinda thing

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 5:53pm):
In the past, I'd agree, but it's like what that guy said in one of those two blog posts (I think...might have been the 4 ways to motivate): progress is a meaningful motivator for all. Easiest way is to start small & snowball. Start with one group that's as broad as individual members & split as needed.

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 5:54pm):
Purpose: bring meaningful, purposeful creativity to Lafayette

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 5:54pm):
So if somehow we can bring together ppl like you like with all of our visions and ideas but that fit with our one
Goal then it will snowball

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 5:55pm):
Intro reading. I have 3 other books after this for us to go through. http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/METHODCARDS-v3-slim.pdf
Correct.
That's why manifesto

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 5:55pm):
Purpose :Cutting the umbilical cord to our afflictions. 
Rising awareness and understanding of the complex dynamics of human emotions and behaviors,relationships.
So how do we
Put those two together
Or underneath or on top
It's all guided towards the same / to bring ppl meaning and awareness about the self
So for an example

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 5:56pm):
Will think on that. Gotta get back on the road. Be back in 1-1.5 hours if still awake. Go check that link. You'll love it.
Keep typing though. I won't get it til home but GOGOGO

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 5:56pm):
If you think about that guy friend of yours / all office hours it's doing is fueling him
It's my dream to share this electric fueling excitement shared when creating meaning
Okok
Drive drive
I ll read
The link

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 7:34pm):
Read any?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 8:01pm):
Yes !
Will comment tomorrow
Cause puppy is snoring and I just got some earbuds to fall asleep
Lol it's 3am here

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 8:02pm):
Of course it is 
Looking forward to discussion!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 8:03pm):
Hahaha I showed her the recording I sent you of her snoring and she was laughing and saying why are you sending that to your friends and then was like " really that was me ,let me hear "

Crawford Comeaux (9/12, 8:03pm):
Lol

Fabiola Sabogal (9/12, 8:03pm):
My mom is hilarious -
Alright
Alright
Looking forward !
Gooossnight
Saturday

Crawford Comeaux (9/13, 4:54pm):
Lol. Total goose night!

Crawford Comeaux (9/13, 5:01pm):
Lots of drinking ending with lots of people skinny dipping 
Sunday

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:17pm):
Tick tock! So little time left!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:18pm):
Lol
Crawford my friend !
WHAT IS UP

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:18pm):
Counting down the hours!!

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:19pm):
I know !! So excited to be going back and getting to WORK !
we have so much to do

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:19pm):
And setting up a program to tweet whenever I'm at UL for office hours.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:20pm):
What kind of programs

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:20pm):
Well...fauxffice hours
A python script

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:20pm):
Explicate

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:21pm):
I am a programmer. I make my machines do my bidding. If they don't know how to, I write programs to tell them.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:21pm):
Well how USEFUL of a skill you got there
Love machines !

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:23pm):
There's a programming language called python. Someone wrote a program in it to be run on jailbroken iPhones. It grabs the gps location from the phone and then ________. I need to write what goes in the blank so that I never have to tell people when I'll be at or heading to UL...just have to give them a twitter account to follow.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:24pm):
Oh like a gps
I use one called life 360
Do you know how to hack into a gmail account ?

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:25pm):
Kinda, but this is specific to the location I want & completely passive. The program runs as soon as the phone starts, so I don't have to lift a finger & it only tweets when I'm in a specific building.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:26pm):
Hmm

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:26pm):
And sure, I could probably get into a specific gmail account. "Hack" would be a strong word for it though

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:26pm):
Lol
If I ever need your help  , would you help me ?

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:27pm):
Lol. I help people who need help when I can. I don't preplan to help 

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:28pm):
good to know

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:28pm):
And I don't violate others' privacy/rights.
Usually

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:28pm):
Unless it's completely an emergency
Lol
Well will see if ever needed

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:30pm):
Basically...the only blanket statement I'm willing to make about what I will/won't do is that I won't make blanket statements about what I will/won't do... outside of this one.
Are you in some sort of trouble? Or planning on getting into some? 

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:33pm):
lol
Well ..
Put it this way
I need a way to talk to someone without no one knowing I am taking to that person
I am using icrypter
But need to make sure somehow the government won't ever been able to find out
Is that icrypter enough
Along with unknown number accounts ?

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:36pm):
Unknown number accounts?
You're referring to the accounts you login to

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:36pm):
Right
Like what'sapps

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:37pm):
You need to talk to them or type to them?
And are you doing something the actual government gives a shit about or are we talking about the 1990s government that supposedly cares if you say/type the word "weed"? 

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:39pm):
We are talking about talking to someone with a restrain order
Restraint

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:40pm):
You want to talk to someone who has a restraining order on you?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:41pm):
There is a restraining order on them
I can talk to them
But they can't talk to me

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:41pm):
And what's the reason for the restraining order?
Just seems odd that you'd have a restraining order out on someone that you want to them violate. Why not just lift it?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:43pm):
Will try when I get back
I will let you know in time

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:43pm):
When was the restraining order placed?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:43pm):
Just need to know I can trust you
May 25th - i has the right to lift it in 3 months

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:44pm):
Sure...I just need to know that I'm not helping you endanger yourself.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:44pm):
Just a question- does the icrypter thing works right
Like can you read this
junp/sRWJ14YrrW8lx5aPQ==
Can you get see what was written there ?

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:45pm):
Nope

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:46pm):
And if u were to "Hack" it

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:46pm):
So...abusive relationship you're looking to rekindle?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:46pm):
Lol
No!
Abusive relationship you are funny

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:47pm):
Most common reason for restraining orders.
Looking to hook up with your stalker?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:47pm):
Well  just a friend that I sent to jail by accident
Called the cops for one thing and he had drugs
And ended up going to jail for another
There it is

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:48pm):
And the one thing?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:48pm):
Called the cops because he had taken my truck
That I have him the keys to
To park at his house and to be move it if needed and then he took it out of the state

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:51pm):
Ah.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 6:55pm):
So I called the cops and they were like we can't send him to jail we can jus you put out a recall out for your truck to be brought back
And then they did that
And he got caught with drugs
And said something like " I am going kill that bitch"
And a restraining order was automatically put on
Ugh
We are buddies

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 6:56pm):
Oh lol

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 7:02pm):
nobody cares about your text messages.
So iCrypter is likely more than enough, depending on how you use it. Haven't used it before, so unsure.

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 7:15pm):
Well let me know if there is away to hack it if you find out

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 7:16pm):
You want to break the messages?

Fabiola Sabogal (9/14, 7:16pm):
I want to see how easy it is to do that yes

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 7:17pm):
Hard. Very hard
But doesn't matter if I have a camera trained on you at all times.

Crawford Comeaux (9/14, 7:46pm):
Security's all relative & depends on how/where you use it.
Monday

Crawford Comeaux (9/15, 12:37pm):
OMG! It's Monday! I don't know wtf happened to Sunday! I must've traveled to the future by just wishing so hard for today to come sooner!

Crawford Comeaux (9/15, 2:59pm):
YOU! ARE YOU HERE YET?!
Today

Crawford Comeaux (10:08am):
Hellooooo?
Today

Fabiola Sabogal (4:52pm):
Heyyyyyy
I am here ?!!

Crawford Comeaux (4:52pm):
In lafayette?!

Fabiola Sabogal (4:53pm):
No in New Orleans ! I got in last night very late - the flight from Charlotte to Nola got delayed ,  for in like midnight ! I am in Nola till Friday and them I ll be in lafayette
Why aren't you here in Nola

Crawford Comeaux (4:55pm):
I'm pretty sure a better question is why aren't you here in LFT
This is ground zero!

Fabiola Sabogal (4:56pm):
Lol
ground zero I like that
What is that

Crawford Comeaux (4:57pm):
The epicenter. Where it all starts.

Fabiola Sabogal (4:57pm):
lol
Ground esto I like that
Ground zero
Well. ... I am just settling in at home / u know I live in Nola and just travel to Lafayette every week to work
Stay there 3 - 4 days

Crawford Comeaux (4:58pm):
Lol I know.

Fabiola Sabogal (4:58pm):
I will be there on Friday
Let's get together Friday night at cafe or something
And talk things out what do you think

Crawford Comeaux (4:59pm):
Ooh! I wonder if we can convince Amtrak to give cheap/free rates for going back & forth between here & there 
Sounds like a plan!

Fabiola Sabogal (4:59pm):
Lol
Well anytime ! I got bunk beds for I to stay here

Crawford Comeaux (5:00pm):
Bunk beds?! So many activities!

Fabiola Sabogal (5:01pm):
Lol
Hahaha
Another name

Crawford Comeaux (5:02pm):
http://youtu.be/moR_v1lmJL4
So how was the flight?? And how long were you in Spain?

Fabiola Sabogal (5:05pm):
Omg !
10 hours to Charlotte and then 2 more hours to Nola
And like 4 hours in the airport waiting on delayed flight
Let me check out that link

Fabiola Sabogal (5:22pm):
Funny
So what about it

Crawford Comeaux (5:23pm):
That's just how I react to bunk beds
Several words/phrases spark start a song or movie clip playing in my head when I hear/read them.
"Bunk beds" = "so many activities"
"impossible" = "Impossible" from the musical play Cinderella
"jam" = "Jam Today" from made for TV musical version of Alice in Wonderland
And many many more (most of them are from musicals)

Fabiola Sabogal (5:31pm):
Lol
So do you think we could use some of this phrases for our groups
Like you know what I mean right ?
We would have different groups in barge of tackling different issues
Related to the same ONE issue
What's is the same one issue ?

Fabiola Sabogal (5:31pm):
Relationships with others but specially with ourselves
For example ,one group called "your momma" lol (jk) will focus on understanding  "reactions" - 90 percent of life could be less painful if we are able to leash up our crazy minds -

Fabiola Sabogal (5:37pm):
Another group will focus on how to let go - and we can create a group ( each group would have a leader that best fits for that kind of issue) with activities such as " gardening" " visiting inmates in jail" " jumping off a cliff lol whatever .. Those are silly examples Besides the gardening , cAuse it really grounds you enough to see life another way and let go of so many paradigms

Crawford Comeaux (6:03pm):
I think first we need to figure out the core common focus. In the open source software world, we've learned that if a project needs to split, it will.
That way we minimize the risk of building clique silos that don't interact.
And when it comes to future planning, identifying a strong vision with loose initial structure tends to work better than trying to predict what all the moving pieces should be and how they should be branded.

Fabiola Sabogal (6:40pm):
Well I am not trying to brand more than I was trying to explain you what I see- the big picture comes easy to me
And details to you so we
Make a great team  !

Crawford Comeaux (6:40pm):
I gotcha!

Fabiola Sabogal (6:40pm):
I just see it being a missionary kinda cause

Crawford Comeaux (6:40pm):
neo-hippie missionary

Fabiola Sabogal (6:40pm):
Hahah
Well CRAWFORD !
First things first

Crawford Comeaux (6:41pm):
a/s/l?
thought we covered that already

Fabiola Sabogal (6:42pm):
Lol
Like back in the day
So after we get some things done I would like to bring the group on here to real life

Crawford Comeaux (6:44pm):
but of course!
is that what you meant by "first thing's first"?

Fabiola Sabogal (6:44pm):
I would like to sit in. A circle with ppl and having. A heart to heart
Just let it out as much as we can

Crawford Comeaux (6:45pm):
sounds good to me
There's a new social network in the works called ello
I have 10 invites. Want one?

Fabiola Sabogal (6:53pm):
What do u mean u have 10 invites

Crawford Comeaux (6:53pm):
people can currently only join if invited

Fabiola Sabogal (6:58pm):
Oh yes please

Crawford Comeaux (6:58pm):
what's your email address?

Fabiola Sabogal (7:04pm):
Fabiolasabogal@gmail.com
Don't back if please LOL
Don't hack it ?
Don't hack it please "

Crawford Comeaux (7:04pm):
too late...already searching it for pics to send to TMZ
sent 
and now I'm opening up your invite email and registering on the site for you...

Fabiola Sabogal (7:17pm):
IMAo
You are funky !
My word for saying  funny

Crawford Comeaux (7:22pm):
I'll take it!

Fabiola Sabogal (7:22pm):
So since you like to create machines maybe you can help create an online estimator for flowrgirls
I can pay you ....
Not as much as you are worth but ...

Crawford Comeaux (7:24pm):
possibly. we can take a look at that on friday

Fabiola Sabogal (7:25pm):
Yeah I just want customers to be able get a "rough" idea of the price they are looking at
So what I am doing now it's just figuring out the costs of materials per feet , yard , etc and then we ll just have to put it all together into a beast
I want to be the first landscaping company in lafayette that's totally digitalized
Like I am building a user session so ppl can log in and look at their history of when we went there , what we did , what they bought.
And also to schedule new visits

Crawford Comeaux (7:27pm):
I wonder if there's already a tool for that sort of thing

Fabiola Sabogal (7:27pm):
and also for the ones that don't schedule , give them reminders that hey it's been 3 months your shit is all grown up agains
Well there is
BUT
I want make it more realiStic with prices from here
I mean it would be cool if you could get one of those apps and fill in the blanks
But u don't think so
I don't think so
Eventually when I am rich I will put a satellite in space to be able to take live shots from the hosues- so i don't ever have to go in person to make estimates lol
Wouldn't that be cool ?!

Crawford Comeaux (7:30pm):
lol nice
don't think you need to be rich for that, though!
in fact...I KNOW you don't!

Fabiola Sabogal (7:32pm):
I have done some estimates through pictures / like. They call ( I don't know them ) and I ask them to send me pictures , then they send pictures I tell them a price (always nail it ) pictures really work I can tell the size what it needs everything ! And we seal a deal through with strangers. That I don't know and then we do the work and it's like oh HEY !!!!nice meeting you

Fabiola Sabogal (7:32pm):
are you aerioualy
SERIOUS !??
HOW
I need that

Crawford Comeaux (7:33pm):
I'll see if I can figure out how to get the plot from someone's address...after that, it's just a matter of using google maps or google earth to measure the area

Fabiola Sabogal (7:35pm):
Well I do that
But !
Not everyone is on google maps
And also it's not a live take
It would be the shit if I can get a live snapshot of the houses so I can see what plants has or how grown up are their landscapes

Crawford Comeaux (7:36pm):
oh lol...nope. wait til you're rich for that 

Fabiola Sabogal (7:37pm):
Lol yeah
That's what I thought

Crawford Comeaux (7:37pm):
but you just want to estimate

Fabiola Sabogal (7:37pm):
I mean there must a program used for that or something like that

Crawford Comeaux (7:37pm):
civilians don't have access to live satellite imagery

Fabiola Sabogal (7:37pm):
I want to be able to cut from the equation having to go in person to give an  estimate
Like it's a pain
And some ppl don't even know how op send pics on text lol

Crawford Comeaux (7:39pm):
lol...that's why the app would accept a video walkaround

Fabiola Sabogal (7:40pm):
Hmmm
The estimator ?

Crawford Comeaux (7:40pm):
yeah
I dunno...do you get much business from online as it is?

Fabiola Sabogal (7:40pm):
Yeahhh
We could write a new kind of estimator
The kinds out there are basic just to figure out prices - this will be a LIVE ESTIMATOR- for the landscaper
And will options for ppl to go online also and get quotes from websites
No
I was doing business with supernova to list me on google
300 bucks a month
Is too much
I did get business

Crawford Comeaux (7:41pm):
SO SO WAY TOO MUCH

Fabiola Sabogal (7:41pm):
But not as much as I do when I put signs out
Yes!!!!
Like I can do my own google Adwords
I used to
But they got me in a time where I was so busy with work and didn't want think about it
But I am talking to ipage to get listed organically
Payed google
Ads are bullshit
The day you don't pay you are not on there
And those bitches GUARANTEED ME 31 days on first page of google and sometimes I would search us and we wouldn't show but on the second third page

Crawford Comeaux (7:43pm):
lame

Fabiola Sabogal (7:44pm):
Because it Costs them money so they had to hide me some days
Lol

Crawford Comeaux (7:45pm):
heh
oh hey! time to write the damned new plan page!

Fabiola Sabogal (7:50pm):
Oh yes !
So when ?
I ve been writing

Crawford Comeaux (7:50pm):
already typing on it

Crawford Comeaux (7:50pm):
gimme 5 mins to slam some shit out

Fabiola Sabogal (7:51pm):
Alright
Listen
I would like for you to copy and paste our conversation about our talk about that theory
