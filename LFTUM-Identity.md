## Notes from NYC
### Culture
- Fix problems, not people.
- Give away as much as possible.
- If you can't give, then share.
- If you can't share, then sell.
- Be fun. Be serious and fun. Be seriously fun. Be solely serious solely for safety. ("Safety first. Learning/Doing/Fun second. Everything else is overhead.")
- Play with anything that doesn't have a name on it.
- Do what you like.
- No judgment...there is no "wrong," there is only "unsafe" and "not working."
- Selfless selfishness? Selfish selflessness?
- #failfriday
- We don't anticipate needs. We address them once they exist.

### Activities
- Help someone make something without them knowing how to do it or how it works
- Collaborative decision making
- Collaborative everything

### Infrastructure
- Anything that's frequently needed is kept visible and near where it'll be used.
- Multiple sources for something can be in the same area.
- Vent straight from machines into shared duct?
- If it can break, make it easy to access.
- The only things bolted down are the things that are designed to be. Everything else gets wheels.
- Storage & organization
- Instant-stop equipment?

### Administration
- Regular inventory
- Never buy something without absolute intention for it
- Regular maintenance checks
- How to keep things clean?
- Be careful who heads or works for the space...find Macguyvers...people who use what's available before buying something.
- How to handle difficult members?

### Kids (...this could/should probably also be applied to adults, too...)
- Time management
- Quick training
- If they're not interested, the presentation's broken
- Trust is super important
- Assess interests
- You're there to learn from them
- Provide platform to express freely...nothing is wrong, it just works or doesn't
- Instill a sense of "I can..."
- Fade away when not needed
- No ambiguity
- Help them self-evaluate

### Random things to research
- "Little Devices"
- "Making Meaning"
- Irridescent - Jarrolyn
- Makerspace handbook - ask peggy @ NYSCI
- tinkering studio @ exploratorium 
- "art of tinkering"
- "design. make. play."
- Ask MakerEd about discussion group/list
- ASTC-Practice
- U-Line = good source of materials

### Ideas
- Trick people who think they can't do something into trying it

### Questions
- How to address violent behavior?



Golden Rules
- Don't be a dick. 
- Judge only ideas and do not judge them based on who they came from or why.
- Children are valuable sources for creative ideas. This includes children ages 18-99+.
- Share everything you can...ideas, knowledge, resources, support, love, etc.
- Collaboration is more important than competition.
- Newbies are there to be taught, not hassled. 
- There are no stupid questions, only asshole answers.
- Technology is impossible without design.
- Design is impossible without technology.
- My intellectual property is my knowledge. What I add to it brings value to the product.
- Bad ideas develop in a bubble. Stolen ideas develop without vision.
- Signors of this manifesto who steal ideas will be ______________, but not before granting rights to the idea originator.
- If an idea is shared with me, and I want to build upon it, I will share responsibility and ownership of this idea with the originator.
- If a business idea is shared and stolen, the community's top priority will be to implement the idea for the originator and make sure it kicks the stolen idea's ass.
- If there is a disagreement about implementation on an idea, efforts should be made to strike a balance between cooperation and competition. Some parts of the design process require a single vision, and so while efforts might be duplicated, the eventual result might not have come any faster through cooperation.
—Ideas are not things. Only implementations or, more tenuously, plans for implementation can be owned or stolen. 
—Humility is a virtue and a discipline. Each idea has a long history; the creative individual is aware that the most any individual can contribute is a thin extra layer or a brilliant implementation.
—Ideas emerge in the stew of social interaction and sharing; Claiming or hoarding ideas is not only wrong (see above) but necessarily leads to creative death. The creative plant dies in the dark.
Idea Sharing/Using Protocol
1. Hear an idea you want to use.
2. Ask the person who had the idea if you can use it.
  2a. Did they say yes? Use it and give them credit for it.
  2b. Did they so no? Don't use it unless it's not an original idea.
  
Concern about idea-sharing: new ideas often precipitate out of other ideas in a community...who owns that? In the sharing new ideas can be created...sometimes imperfect copies, other times they are put together with other ideas like an alloy to make them stronger.



Honesty

-An endless list of rules is not beneficial for anyone.
----- This just a starting point and not the final product.
-  The only way to ensure problems get fixed is by openly addressing them.
- Everything is presented and portrayed as it is, not more and not less.
- Constructive criticism is desired, but not required. 
- It is unfair to expect suggestions from non-experts.
- Most feedback has value. Even someone who hates something without any reason given is representing some market.
- I always insist the best-suited platform be used for the product I am developing.
- I admit when I don't know something.
- I present all viable options and not just the ones I like.
- I will use existing technologies when available and only resort to creating my own when there is profound reason to do so. (AKA I will not succumb to NIH Syndrome.)
----- ^^^^ THIS SO MUCH
- I will think about what kinds of skills are needed on a project in the future, and who has to do work to maintain it (content-creation, maintenance, redesigns, etc) and communicate the long-term expectations.
- Be honest about the target market size and the profitability at realistic/achievable levels of market share

Science 
Quality
Science-based Quality
- I will assume nothing, including that I know what I'm talking about.
- If it isn't a testable hypothesis, it's a religious opinion and to be left for the zealots to argue about.
- Disinguish competing values, understanding that we often make conscious trade-offs that have to be appropriate to the situation, stability vs agility, affordability vs quality, but also noting that the status quo of these tradeoffs can often be mistaken
- I will test all hypotheses and make decisions based on qualitative/quantitative data.
- The gut is for processing food, not ideas.
- Expertise results from internalizing what we think of in a field. It often involves "gut" reasoning, but a proper argument should always be provided with the caveat that one can recognize rationalization over reasoning.
- Zealotry is for the birds, not professionals.
- There are no wrong opinions. 
- There are opinions and there are statements that deny facts/data/reality.
- Innovation often takes in a context like an ecosystem, and the reputation of a vendor or myself is important aspect of the business aspect of technical decision-making.
- Measuring effects when they are at their largest less costly than work to measure it, it's not a relevant factor
- Professionalism is shown through the quality of my work, not my outward appearance.
- Being a professional does not require taking myself too seriously.

Authority
- "The customer is always right" leads to bad product.
- I am the expert in my field, not the client. Their input is welcome and necessary, but their ideas can be wrong. It's my job to help mold their ideas into useful solutions to their problems or create something better.
- A good client recognizes me as the expert.
- There are no bad clients because I don't do work for those people.
- I am responsible for building, maintaining, and expanding the talent in my business or workplace, including but not limited to influencing competitiveness in the local market and effectiveness of local educational institutions where I'm able.
- I will hold no one responsible for what is outside their authority to achieve
- Whoever is implementing an idea will get more weight in technical discussions than they might otherwise receive
- I will be clear to other vendors where their responsibilities end and ours begin
—My authority resides in my abilities to develop an implementation that works well. All other claims to authority are bogus.

Originality
- Before saying "Nothing like this idea exists," all search engine results will be exhausted.
- Since search engine results can't be exhausted, never say "Nothing like this idea exists."
- Copying a product and rebranding it locally is not innovation.
- Copying and changing an existing idea only slightly is incremental change, not innovation.

Personal Development
- I keep up with and apply the latest trends/technology in my field.
- If I can't apply the latest trends/tech when working, I will still practice them outside of work.
- If a workplace refuses to evolve with technology for an extended period of time, find a new workplace that will evolve.
- I will maintain a well-rounded skill set to be capable of suggesting the best or multiple solutions to any given problem.

Creativity
- The primary goal of creation is to solve a problem.
- Focusing on money distracts from and hinders creativity. This applies to a company's end goal as much as it does to what its hiring goals should be.
- I will not begin the creative process by asking "What can I do for money?"
- I will deeply explore problems with the goal of understanding them and empathizing with who they impact.
- It is important to expose and explore all ideas in a discussion, even those that may seem bad or ineffective in their first incarnations.
- Ideas are cheap, abundant, expendable, and the least expensive phase at which to iterate in the product development lifecycle. Don't become too attached to or be afraid to change or discard one.
- Discussion around planning and creativity should not involve organizational hierarchy. Decide who has the power to make the final decision, but allow everyone to hash out their arguments and opinions for different ideas on how to reach a goal.
---- "A flat organization is a collaborative organization, but pick someone to make the final decision."
