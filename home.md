# Lafayette's Unnamed Makerspace

## What is a makerspace?
>A Makerspace is a learning environment rich with possibilities. As new hardware and software tools for making, digital design, and fabrication are emerging, we’re working together — with teachers and community leaders — to place those tools into the hands of a wider audience. We’re building the infrastructure for more kids and adults to connect to a future in which they can personally change, modify or “hack” the physical world, creating things that were nearly impossible to do on their own just a few years ago. Making is about getting hands-on, using these new technologies and basic tools, to do real and personally meaningful work.

## What's this about free tools from a local hardware shop?

We should organize people to visit the hardware shop that takes these coupons (the one across the street from Jason's deli) once a day for 6 days for people to either help build their tool set or help build ours. Must emphasize the need for everyone to purchase something IF THEY CAN. If they can't afford to, that's ok, but if they can, they should.

## What we're about

## Why is this site so bare bones right now?
Because we're focusing on research before we bother with site design
