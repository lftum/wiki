## Results of parsing sticky notes with Mary Zorn

#### These are numbered because that's how Mary needed to write them. The order isn't set in stone. Neither is the wording. Neither is any other aspect of any of this.

1. Educate the area on the value of creative work that's different and/or risky.
2. A space that enables creatives to become experts and teaches them how to present their expertise through novel content, innovation, and experimentation.
3. A space that teaches creatives how to self-evaluate, give/receive healthy criticism, and help the community grow through these means.
4. Seeking to create a transparent, living organization with open & honest channels of communication.
5. Encourage personal and/or professional development; enable members to gain skills that positively improve their lives and chosen paths.
6. Culture that encourages and facilitates experimentation and risk taking in order to instill self-confidence in members with respect to the value they already possess.
7. An organization that collaborates internally and externally, by default.
8. A safe place that's free from judgement -- regardless of age, religion, race, gender, orientation, economic status, profession, and experience level -- for the sake of allowing people to do what they need/want and for kumbaya bullshit.
9. Instill values of deep learning/understanding and critical analysis.
10. An organization that is socially conscious and environmentally aware.
11. Our values come first.

##### Community Building
A special note about these (and likely other stickies/qualities that need to be identified): 

They embody jaded people who may seem like they should be part of the initial/core community, but have a high risk of poisoning the well. These qualities are a good starting point for identifying criteria that disqualifies candidates via the selection process for new members during the early generations of the community. Once the community & its culture have reached a point where these issues can be naturally accounted for, we can use them as selection criteria for a small group of test subjects to determine whether or not we've reached the point that we can overcome the issues without the community being poisoned.
- narrowly defines "creative fields"
- recognizes too few creative fields
- is disengaged
- isn't education non-creatives how to appreciate creative work
- isn't urging people to allow for work that's different/risky
- views tech & art as separate

## Sticky notes from the CES discussion panel video

These are problems facing the creative community of Lafayette as identified from the discussion panel in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J45z8aMwl-U

The separate sections identify the level at which problems exist and/or are experienced. There are numerous unstated/unidentified relationships in this set. The fairly disorganized nature of these things should give people insight into how my (Crawford) brain works. It can produce insights, but they will be jumbled. This is why I need help when it comes to sorting through complex problems for the sake of communicating them clearly to others.

Some people may find the wording for some/all of these to be too negative or inflammatory. I apologize for that...it's simply a byproduct of how I analyze things. I need to be problem-focused before I can become solution-focused. I hope that you can see past that to identify the core issues trying to be addressed here. Also, please realize that if we assume these problems to be accurate assessments of Lafayette and we wind up being wrong, the worst case scenario is the development of a badass hackerspace in an attempt to solve problems that don't exist. I'm ok with that if you are.
