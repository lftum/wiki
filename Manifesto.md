# Manifesto 
#### (and all the bits that contribute to its development)
< insert manifesto here >

I don't know how this manifesto will look, but complacency will be antithetical to it. 

Want something changed? Change it.

Edit on the left, live preview on the right.

This wiki runs on Markdown, which is a super-simple markup language for formatting things like wiki pages. That's what all the hashes/pounds ('#') are. Actually, this wiki supports a couple of flavors of Markdown. 

### Links to relevant guides: 
- [The Original Markdown Guide - The Basics](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics "Basics of Markdown")
- [The Original Markdown Guide - Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Syntax of Markdown")
- [Github-flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown "Github's guide on Github-Flavored Markdown")

Think these aren't clear enough? Get to googling, find better ones, and then use what you learn to add your own links to the list. Maybe add a note on how your links are an improvement on the previous guides or the type of people who may find yours more useful? We're all in this together, but that's meaningless if we aren't thoughtfully contributing. 

Speaking of being thoughtful, try to keep things accessible to screen reading software by giving your links a descriptive title. If you hover over a link with the mouse, you'll see the title. Here's the markdown from a passage down the page (I added the > at the beginning to turn the passage into a blockquote):
```

"Facebook event page for the Creative Economy Summit") on November 11, 2011 
and was primarily attended by people involved in art, film, music, and theater.

Here's what it produces:

## Inspiration behind LFTUM

### The Beginning
In 2011, I (Crawford Comeaux, self-appointed Benevolent Dictator For Life of LFTUM) worked at FiberCorps, a now-defunct non-profit whose long-term sustainability required Lafayette to develop a startup culture, ie. something similar to our own version of Silicon Valley. In order to help develop the vision for FiberCorps, he researched what a city needed in order to evolve a startup culture. That led to a list of requirements that an [innovation ecosystem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation_system "Wikipedia entry for 'innovation system'") needed for that to happen, which I split into things Lafayette has and things it doesn't.

Some time after that research was completed, an event was held at the [LITE Center](http://www.lite3d.com "LITE Center's website") called the [Creative Economy Summit](https://www.facebook.com/events/272940536060680/ "Facebook event page for the Creative Economy Summit") on November 11, 2011 and was primarily attended by people involved in art, film, music, and theater. The event closed with a discussion panel that identified the needs/challenges facing the creative community, though a lot of the discussion was focused on the more artistic subset of the community while acknowledging that the scope of who was considered part of the creative community needed expanding. It was through this discussion that my mind was blown.

During the discussion panel, instead of taking notes, I wound up simply checking off items in my list of things Lafayette needs before it can evolve a startup culture. By the end of the discussion, I'd checked off every item and didn't need to add any others. 

Mind. Blown.

The needs of the artistic community were exactly the same as the city's tech/innovation needs. 

Everyone has a similar reaction when I tell this story: "Oh yeah! Because creativity!" 

This led to a couple new revelations:

1. We can meet the needs of both groups by crafting solutions that don't exclude one or the other.
2. In a conservative area such as Lafayette, where the message of "fund the arts" is an uphill battle, tech & arts sectors should come together to identify their collective needs and rally around the message of "fund the innovation systems."

### Two Years Later



## Vision

## Mission

## Results of parsing sticky notes with Mary Zorn

#### These are numbered because that's how Mary needed to write them. The order isn't set in stone. Neither is the wording. Neither is any other aspect of any of this.

1. Educate the area on the value of creative work that's different and/or risky.
2. A space that enables creatives to become experts and teaches them how to present their expertise through novel content, innovation, and experimentation.
3. A space that teaches creatives how to self-evaluate, give/receive healthy criticism, and help the community grow through these means.
4. Seeking to create a transparent, living organization with open & honest channels of communication.
5. Encourage personal and/or professional development; enable members to gain skills that positively improve their lives and chosen paths.
6. Culture that encourages and facilitates experimentation and risk taking in order to instill self-confidence in members with respect to the value they already possess.
7. An organization that collaborates internally and externally, by default.
8. A safe place that's free from judgement -- regardless of age, religion, race, gender, orientation, economic status, profession, and experience level -- for the sake of allowing people to do what they need/want and for kumbaya bullshit.
9. Instill values of deep learning/understanding and critical analysis.
10. An organization that is socially conscious and environmentally aware.
11. Our values come first.

### Sticky notes not yet addressed by the items above

##### Community Outreach
- is disconnected

##### Agency
- is complacent

##### Collective Voice
- is disconnected at the individual level
- has no collective voice
- thinks on an individual level
- is highly competitive

##### Community Building
A special note about these (and likely other stickies/qualities that may already be addressed above in the numbered list made with Mary): 

They embody jaded people who may seem like they should be part of the initial/core community, but have a high risk of poisoning the well. These qualities are a good starting point for identifying criteria that disqualifies candidates via the selection process for new members during the early generations of the community. Once the community & its culture have reached a point where these issues can be naturally accounted for, we can use them as selection criteria for a small group of test subjects to determine whether or not we've reached the point that we can overcome the issues without the community being poisoned.
- narrowly defines "creative fields"
- recognizes too few creative fields
- is disengaged
- isn't educating non-creatives how to appreciate creative work
- isn't urging people to allow for work that's different/risky
- views tech & art as separate, as opposed to them as members of the creativity superset

## Sticky notes from the CES discussion panel video

These are problems facing the creative community of Lafayette as identified from the discussion panel in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J45z8aMwl-U

The separate sections identify the level at which problems exist and/or are experienced. There are numerous unstated/unidentified relationships in this set. The fairly disorganized nature of these things should give people insight into how my (Crawford) brain works. It can produce insights, but they will be jumbled. This is why I need help when it comes to sorting through complex problems for the sake of communicating them clearly to others.

Some people may find the wording for some/all of these to be too negative or inflammatory. I apologize for that...it's simply a byproduct of how I analyze things. I need to be problem-focused before I can become solution-focused. I hope that you can see past that to identify the core issues trying to be addressed here. Also, please realize that if we assume these problems to be accurate assessments of Lafayette and we wind up being wrong, the worst case scenario is the development of a badass hackerspace in an attempt to solve problems that don't exist. I'm ok with that if you are.
